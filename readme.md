# Has It Happened Yet? (A Wordpress Theme)

This is an oh-so-simple theme that can power a simple site dedicated to answering
one question with a single-word answer, like "Has the Baby Been Born Yet?" or 
"Is your secret project launched yet?" or "Is supper ready yet?" or anything
along those lines. The question appears in small print at the top of the screen,
and the answer appears in very-large letters just below that.

This theme is mobile-device ready and it looks good on screens of all sizes.

Oh, and the whole thing is 30 lines of pretty-readable code, mostly HTML and CSS.

## Directions

After installing and activating this theme, there are a couple items to configure:

1. Under **settings/general**, set your **site title** to whatever you want to show 
   in the title bar. I set mine to "Baby Status" but you can get as cute as you
   want with it.

2. On the same settings page, set your **tagline** to the question you want the
   site to answer. 

3. Now you're ready to answer the question! To do this, write a new Post and 
   answer the question in your title.  Include any other informational 
   paragraphs in the body of the post.


## About

I threw this theme together in a few minutes late one night to help me
keep family and friends up to date on the arrival status of our newest family
member during the last couple of days before his arrival.  We were completely
uninterested in responding to all the texts and facebook messages we were getting
so I built this quickly in the interest of keeping people up to date.

Yes, WordPress was total overkill for something as simple as this, but it afforded
me one HUGE advantage: ***I could update it from the Wordpress mobile app.*** This
single feature alone made Wordpress the right platform. We kept everyone up to
date from home, from the car on the way to the hospital, and from the hospital
as everything was happening. Everyone **loved** it.

Technology can be amazing sometimes.
