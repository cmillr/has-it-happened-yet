Theme Name: Has It Happened Yet? 
Version: 0.1

This is an oh-so-simple theme built to help me
to keep family and friends up to date on the arrival status of our newest family
member during the last couple of days before his arrival.  We were completely
uninterested in responding to all the texts and facebook messages we were getting
so I threw this together in the interest of keeping people up to date.

Yes, WordPress was total overkill for something as simple as this, but it afforded
me one HUGE advantage: I could update it from the Wordpress mobile app. This
single feature alone made Wordpress the right platform.
